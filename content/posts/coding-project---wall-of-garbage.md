## Concept

This was a quick demo I made for testing out some technologies I have been curious about. I am currently taking a database class that has coding projects in postgreSQL. For that reason, I wanted to try setting up my own database end accessing it through and API. I decided to use CockroachDB because it is free and easy to setup.
