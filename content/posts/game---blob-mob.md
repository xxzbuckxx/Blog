## Concept

This game was one of my first coding projects, and I originally made it using a single file of javascript and some boilerplate HTML.

The game has evolved a lot since then, using typescript for the core game and React for the UI components.

A web game I designed with a global leaderboard, an upgrade shop, and account functionality to save progress. The top down arcade was fully designed and implemented by me.
