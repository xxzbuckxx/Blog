## Concept

This is a visualization for an algorithm that distributes points evenly on a sphere. My first attempts were at implementing the algorithm myself using [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9600801/evenly-distributing-n-points-on-a-sphere/44164075#44164075). However, I did not quite get the visualization I wanted, so I used [Sebastion Lague's implementation](https://gitiub.com/SebLague/Boids/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/BoidHelper.cs) instead.
