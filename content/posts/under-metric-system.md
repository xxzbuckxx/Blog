## Concept

During my 2022 internship with [Under.io](https://under.io) I was tasked with making an interactive dashboard. 

At a startup, it is crucial to understand where the business is at. That is why I was tasked with building an admin dashboard that displayed important site metrics and allowed easy access of customer data.
